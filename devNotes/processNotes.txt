Process Notes for Express with Datasets Study
=============================================




About Process Notes
===================
"Process Notes" is a step-by-step workflow document that outlines the "phases" of my study/app development and the successive steps taken at each
milestone of the examination. In the case of studies, the process notes might be eschewed in favor of the main Readme document in the repository, 
mostly because of the advantage in formatting and accessibility. However, I will put additional notes and resource links that might be helpful. In 
the case of application development, groups of related steps are combined into "phase" modules so that they can be reorganized and refined in 
post-review. This has proven to be EXTREMELY helpful in learning (i.e. Feynman technique (https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/)) and refining 
workflow so I can improve my process in future projects. It also has come in handy for some tricky bug fixes not only for past projects, but this 
one as well so I would urge you to consider at least doing a rough summary for your own benefit.

Application outline:
